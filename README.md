# Distance-Based Parking Assistant 🚗🅿️  

## Overview  
The **Distance-Based Parking Assistant** is a smart system designed to help drivers park safely by using an **ultrasonic sensor** to measure distance and a **buzzer** to provide audio feedback. The buzzer adjusts its intensity based on the distance to an obstacle, ensuring smooth and safe parking.  

## Features  
- **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement**: Detects obstacles in real time.  
- **Adaptive Buzzer Feedback**:  
  - **Fast beeping** → Very close to an obstacle.  
  - **Slow beeping** → Moderate distance from an obstacle.  
  - **No beep** → Safe distance.    

## Technologies Used  
- **Arduino** (for sensor integration & control)  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** (for distance measurement)  
- **Buzzer** (for parking assistance feedback)
